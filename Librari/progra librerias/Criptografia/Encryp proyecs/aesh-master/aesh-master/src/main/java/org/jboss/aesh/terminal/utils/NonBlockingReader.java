 * This class wraps a regular reader and allows it to appear as if it

 * waiting on the thread to complete.

 *   <li> This class is not thread safe. It expects at most one reader.
 *   <li> The {@link #shutdown()} method must be called in order to shut down
 *          the thread that handles blocking I/O.
